# Uber-Trips-Analysis-using-Python
This project aims to analyze the Uber trips dataset for New York City. The dataset contains data of about 4.5 million uber pickups in New York City from April to September and 14.3 million pickups from January to June 2015. 

## Dataset

The dataset can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/fivethirtyeight/uber-pickups-in-new-york-city). It consists of six CSV files, one for each month from January to June 2015.

## Analysis

The analysis is done using Python programming language and its libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The analysis is done according to the days and hours of the day, as we are using the Uber trips for the September month.

### Analyzing Uber Trips by Day

We analyzed the Uber trips according to each day of the week to see on which day the Uber trips were highest. We found that Monday is the most profitable day for Uber while Saturdays have fewer people using it.

### Analyzing Uber Trips by Hour

We analyzed the Uber trips according to each hour of the day to see which hour has the highest number of pickups. We found that 6 pm is the busiest hour for Uber while on average a rise in Uber trips starts around 5 am.

### Analyzing Uber Trips by Weekday

We analyzed the correlation between hours and weekdays on the number of pickups. We found that there is a high demand for pickups during rush hours on weekdays (Monday-Friday) while weekends have fewer pickups throughout all hours.

### Origin of Pickups

We also analyzed where most of the pickups originate from in New York City. We found that most of them originate near Manhattan region in New York City.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project provides insights into analyzing large datasets such as the Uber trips dataset. The analysis done in this project shows that Monday is the most profitable day for Uber, 6 pm is the busiest hour for Uber, and most of the pickups originate near Manhattan region in New York City.
